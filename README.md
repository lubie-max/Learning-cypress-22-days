  test cases in Synchronouse fasion, this is one of its features.

## Why one should use it?

### Cypress is a batteries included testing framework which provoids different features.

like-

- Ease to Debug.
- Time Traveling. It takes snapshots of each step.
- Automatic Waiting
- Screenshots and Videos
  etc.

# Days

## 0-6 : All basic, its pros and cons , nature and making some tests and assertion.

- 🔰 Each line/command returns a promise. >> test.js

## 7 : alerts handling.

- 🔰 cypress automatically handles the alerts. To insure that the alert got handled. used .on() function. which takes window events like alerts >>'window:alert' and a callback function which yeilds the response/returned value . then checked that recieved str equels to the given str (alert msg). >> Test3.js

## 8 : tabs and child window handling -

- 🔰 cypress doesn't support child windows or tabs, we have to manually code for it. for that, used invoke() to yeild the function and function to be yeild was removeAttr() {jQuery} >> Test3.js

## 9 : Table handling.

- 🔰 Learnt about .next() to access next sibling of `<td>` >> Test4.js
- 🔰 Mouse hovering: code with jQuery function (show()) >> Test5.js

## 10 : IFrames handling .

- 🔰 Learnt about cypress-iframe package in cypress >> Test6.js
- 🔰 Basic understanding of fixtures with new site.

## 11 : Fixtures and hooks.

- 🔰 getting data from other files(fixtures) and Hooks in cypress.>>TestWithFixture.js
  🔸 before() hook takes a callback function but doesn't support to arrow function. and also it() too. while using hook.

## 12 : JSON data with fixture and Validation

- 🔰cy.get(':nth-child(1) > .form-control').should('have.attr','minlength','2')

- 🔰 2 way data binding and min-len validation. >>TestWithFixture.js

- 🔰 Costum commands in cypress. folder = cypress/support/commands.js >>TestWithFixture.js

- 🔰 To Debug the tests we can use cy.pause() and cy.debug() functions or browser console to track the actions or snapshots from cypress itself.

## 13 : Implementing Page Object Design pattern.

- 🔰 Making code more readable and scalable with Object Class >> cypress/integration/PageObjects.

## 14: Setting environmental variables and automated shop page.

- 🔰 automated shopping page. With full validation of products' pricess >>testWithFixture02.js

## 15 : environmental variable // common url.

- 🔰 calling an env var => Cypress.env('url') >>cypress.config.js

## 16 : cypress dashboard. and terminal commands.

- 🔰 >> npx cypress run --record --key <key provoided by cypress dashboard> --spec cypress/integration/examples/\*.js --headed --browser chrome
- 🔰 above command runs the test in respected browser and --key is key provoided by cypress dashboard

## 17 : command line and jenkins intro

- 🔰 commands and script costumization.

- 1️⃣ >> cypress run ➡ runs the testcases in terminal (headless).

- 2️⃣ >> cypress run --headed ➡ runs the testcases in cypress window (headed).

- 3️⃣ >> cypress run --browser chrome ➡ runs the testcases in terminal (headless).

## 18: Jenkins Integration with Cypress.

- 🔰 Setting up Jenkins.
- 1️⃣ installed Jenkins WAR file from official site.
- 2️⃣ ran >>java -jar jenkins.war . command in cmd/terminal to open the window.
- 3️⃣ http://localhost:8080 url for the jenkins window.

⭕ ps: Let the plugins be installed.

- 4️⃣ Next, Provoid, genereted password from cmd to the Jenkins(Localhost:8080).

- 5️⃣ To create new job/item: Go to :
➡ Dashboard
➡ New Item ➡ Provoid ProjectName , (Freestyle Project) for now.
➡Configuration: Check for parameterized Project(if neccessery).
and Source Code Management- Git
➡Build Step => Execute Windows Batch commands
and Save.

- 🔰 Resolved the .sh issue with jenkins Script Runner(Execute Windows Batch commands) ➡ npm run %Script%.
  ps: do not use execute shell. Instead, use (Execute Windows Batch commands).

## 19 : Brief about BDD(Behavior Driven Development) with Cucumber and setting env.

- 🔰 Installation and env setup(files) ➡ [Docs](https://github.com/badeball/)
- 🔰 Basic Syntax and Folder Structure.

## 20 : First BDD(Behavior Driven Development), Data Driven Testing and Tags, Test with Cucumber

- 🔰 Used Tags and Data in cumber >> ecommerce.js and ecommerce.feature

## 21 : Generating Reports with Html.

- 🔰  installing mochawesome-reporter
`>> npm i --save-dev cypress-mochawesome-reporter`
